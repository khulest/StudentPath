
 StudentPath is a system designed to track and manage the daily attendance and schedules of school students. It helps ensure that students are safely accounted for during their bus rides and in class. 

Key features of StudentPath include:
- **Attendance Tracking**: Records if students are present or absent for both their bus rides and classes. If a student is absent, parents are automatically notified.
- **Parent Notifications**: Parents receive alerts if their child misses the bus or class. This helps them stay informed in real-time.
- **Class Schedules**: Displays the student's daily class schedule so both teachers and parents can keep track.
- **Easy Access for School Staff**: Teachers and bus drivers can quickly mark attendance and view schedules, making the system simple and efficient to use.
